# rubyreads
A small Goodreads clone on Ruby on Rails


List of features to work on:
* ~Get basic CRUD app going with rails g scaffold like the Rails 7 demo~
* ~Add CSS styles~ 
* Add database table for reviews (name, date, review). May need to add :has_many? relationship to books table and run a db migration
* Add view partial for user reviews to route that shows all existing books? (is a view partial the best way to do this?)
* Validate that title and author fields can't be empty 
* Pull images of book covers from somewhere, and display them when listing hte books we have and while editing books
* Add option to auto-populate summary using an API? Might be the same API taht fetches book cover images
