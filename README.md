This application is a simple book review site, used as a way to get familiar with working on a Rails app. It probably won't be much more than a simple site to create, view, update, and delete books and reviews for them. I'm hoping to be able to add comments to book reviews as well

The usual `gem install rails` and then `bundle install` from inside the rubyreads folder should be sufficient to install the needed dependencies

Use `rails s` to run the app on the Puma server locally, and `rails console` to open a console that will let you interact with the app via Ruby commands
